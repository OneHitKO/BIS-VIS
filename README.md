# Bis-Vis
Bis-Vis is an interactive tool to visualize bisulfite amplicon sequencing data. Bis-Vis creates an R Shiny App that allows users to select specific samples, donors, treatments, and other user-defined parameters for publication-ready figures. 

### Requirements
- R
- CpG methylation coverage reports (output of Bismark methylation calling of bisulfite-seq FASTQ files)
- Sample Sheet (csv) file which specifies the name of the samples and user-defined paramters

### Upcoming features
- Integrated statistical analyses report
- Visualization in genome browser
