# Bis-Vis
Bis-Vis is an interactive tool to visualize bisulfite amplicon sequencing data. Bis-Vis creates an R Shiny App that allows users to select specific samples, donors, treatments, and other user-defined parameters for publication-ready figures. An integrated statistics tool allows for statistical analysis to be performed between two specified groups. 

### Features
- User defined sample parameters to allow for grouped comparisons
- Statistical analysis

### Requirements
- R
- CpG methylation coverage reports (output of Bismark methylation calling of bisulfite-seq FASTQ files)
